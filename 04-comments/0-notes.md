## General Idea

### Comments are often lies waiting to happen!
### Code should speak for itself. Code should be the single source of truth!

---
That's said..,
* Comments do not make up for bad code, code itself is.
* Well documented code is different from, well-commented code.
  * Proper use of comments is to compensate for our **failure** to express ourself in
  code
  * Explain yourself in code as much as possible
    * extract it in the variable name
    * extract it in the function/class name or the body
    
* EOD, Avoid comments, unless it's really necessary to have it

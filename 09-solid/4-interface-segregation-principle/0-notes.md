# Interface Segregation Principle

![Illustration: Interface segregation principle](../storage/4-interface-segregation-principle.png)

* A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.
  * It’s all about knowledge.
  * Why should you know something you don’t need to know?
* Separate fat interfaces into smaller interfaces since you might break SRP.

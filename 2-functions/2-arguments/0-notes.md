 Rule of Thumb
---

 * The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic)

 Next comes one ,
 Followed closely by two (dyadic),

 Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible

 More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway

 > With the increase of arguments, scenarios testing code snippet also increases

 Flag Arguments (monadic)

 One word, UGLY!!

 Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice

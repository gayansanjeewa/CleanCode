YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
---

 * is trying to save us time and focus on most important things in our todo.

 * if its not needed now, it may never be needed later.

 * the requirements could potentially change in the future.

 * always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee them


#Sample User Story

As a user, I should see the list of resources
---
The resources are saved in a database and through a handler, I should be be able to get the list of resources objects, so then I could list them on the user interface.

It is important to note that these resources would potentially be between 10 - 50 items maximum.


**Acceptance Criteria**
 * Implement a resource handler to get the list of resources
 * The list of resources can be objects to be later displayed in a user interface

### Boy Scout Rule
    Always leave the code you're editing better than you found it. 
    ~ Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

### Speaker notes
- Boy Scouts have a rule regarding camping, that they should leave the campground cleaner than they found it.
- Some teams take the approach of shutting down all value-adding work and simply trying to clean up the codebase for a week or a month or some other period of time.
- The Boy Scout Rule suggests an alternative approach, which is to simply try and ensure that with each commit, you leave the code better than you found it. Eventually you will have a better code.
- When you find a code that's need to be refactored, but it's not the time for it, set a Todo comment with a counter.
  <br>
  `// Todo: Refactor this, requset count 4`
  <br>
  And each time some one reach that peace of code and find the need to refactor, they increment that count. When you in the beach and have some time to loose, find the most Todo with the request count and refactor just that

# Clean code

## Introduction
   
## Code Quality / Practices
1. Naming Conventions
   * most difficult things in programming
2. Functions
   * Return early
   * Arguments
   * Law of demeter
3. Exceptions
   * Don’t return null, don't pass null
4. Comments
5. DRY  
6. Boy scout rule
7. YAGNI
8. Yoda?

## Clean Architecture 
9. Blueprint - architecture
10. Frameworks - To do or not to do
   * Do not tightly couple business logic with the framework
   * Treat frameworks like a plug in that you use to make your life easy, you should be able to swap out another framework if needed without much cost.
11. Boundaries
   * Create a boundary for packages you used within you code base so you don’t depend on those. With this way you can quickly swap out the packages you use if the time comes
12. SOLID
13. CQRS

## TDD / Unit tests
   * First Law You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
   * Second Law You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not com-piling is failing.
   * Third Law You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the cur-rently failing test.

## Tools
   * Sonarqube
   * CS fixers
   * CI/CD
   * Code Reviews

## Going forward
   * Mentor someone
   * Read a book - Clean Code - Robert C. Martin
   * Join [CMS](https://www.cms.lk) or a company which would enable you with an environment to practice clean code.

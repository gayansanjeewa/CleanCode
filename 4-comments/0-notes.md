## General Idea

* Comments do not make up for bad code

* Comments are often lies waiting to happen.

* Well documented code is different from, well-commented code.

* Code should speak for it self. Code should be the single source of truth! 
    > Proper use of comments is to compensate for our **failure** to express ourself in
  code
  
    > Explain yourself in code as much as possible

* Avoid comments, unless its really necessary to have it
